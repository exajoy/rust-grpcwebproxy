# Griffin - A lightweight gRPC-Web to gRPC proxy

In the world of package transmission, gRPC-Web and gRPC are becoming increasingly polular.
However, the current solutions of converting gRPRC-Web to gRPC, such as Envoy,
are often too large and complex for lightweight applications.

Griffin is a lightweight proxy built on top of hyper.rs that translate gRPC-web to standard gRPC requests.
Griffin's binary is only [1MB](https://github.com/exajoy/griffin/releases), **100x smaller** than Envoy's binary [(140MB+)](https://hub.docker.com/r/envoyproxy/envoy/tags?name=dev) and **15x smaller**
than grpcwebproxy [(15.3MB)](https://github.com/improbable-eng/grpc-web/releases) **without garbage collection**.

## Features

Griffin supports both gRPC-web and gRPC traffics at the same time:

- Interoeprability between grpc-web clients and grpc servers

```
grpc-web client <--> griffin (grpc-web to grpc proxy) <--> grpc server
```

- Minimal gRPC reverse proxy

```
grpc client <--> griffin <--> grpc server
```

- Support 2 types of grpc-web requests (unary and server streaming)
- Support 4 types standard grpc requests (unary request, server streaming, client streaming, bidi streaming)

## How to use

```ssh
griffin \
--proxy-host=127.0.0.1 \
--proxy-port=8080 \
--forward-host=127.0.0.1 \
--forward-port=3000
```
